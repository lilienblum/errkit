# errkit

Declare errors once in `errkit.json`, generate TypeScript, Go, and Rust catalogs. The CLI has zero runtime dependencies.

```bash
npx errkit init       # creates errkit.json in the current directory
# ... edit errkit.json ...
npx errkit generate   # backfills codes, writes every output file
```

## errkit.json

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://unpkg.com/errkit@latest/schema.json",

  "outputs": [
    { "path": "src/errors.ts", "scopes": ["server"] },
    { "path": "internal/errs/errors.go" },
    { "path": "src/errors.rs" }
  ],

  "common": {
    "user_not_authorized": { "description": "User is not authorized" }
  },

  "scopes": {
    "server": {
      "database_unavailable": { "description": "Database is unavailable" }
    }
  }
}
```

Entries don't need a `code` — `errkit generate` fills in any missing ones and writes them back to `errkit.json`.

## Use generated codes

### TypeScript

Generated TypeScript files export an `Err` enum for codes. Descriptions are internal developer context only: they are emitted as JSDoc above enum members for editor hover and generated-file readability, but they are not exported as runtime data.

For this `errkit.json` entry:

```json
{
  "common": {
    "user_not_found": {
      "description": "User was not found",
      "code": "K7M2QP"
    }
  }
}
```

errkit generates a TypeScript enum member named `Err.UserNotFound`:

```ts
export enum Err {
  /** User was not found */
  UserNotFound = "K7M2QP",
}
```

Import the generated enum and alias it if you want to refer to the service as `AuthService`:

```ts
import { Err as AuthService } from "./auth-service-errors";

export function userNotFoundResponse() {
  const code = AuthService.UserNotFound;

  return Response.json({ code }, { status: 404 });
}
```

For an entry named `user_not_found`, the generated member is `Err.UserNotFound`. The `AuthService.UserNotFound` form above comes from importing the generated enum with an alias.

If application code needs to return a runtime description, keep that mapping in application code and key it by the generated enum value:

```ts
import { Err as AuthService } from "./auth-service-errors";

const authServiceDescriptions = {
  [AuthService.UserNotFound]: "User was not found",
} satisfies Partial<Record<AuthService, string>>;

export function userNotFoundPayload() {
  const code = AuthService.UserNotFound;
  const description = authServiceDescriptions[code];

  return { code, description };
}
```

### Go

Generated Go constants have type `Code`. They are codes, not error wrappers, so they do not implement Go's `error` interface. Descriptions are emitted only as comments above constants for internal developer context.

For this `errkit.json` entry:

```json
{
  "common": {
    "auth_service_user_not_found": {
      "description": "User was not found",
      "code": "K7M2QP"
    }
  }
}
```

errkit generates a Go constant named `AuthServiceUserNotFound`:

```go
type Code string

const (
	// User was not found
	AuthServiceUserNotFound Code = "K7M2QP"
)
```

Because `AuthServiceUserNotFound` is a `Code`, wrap it in an error type before returning it from a function:

```go
package auth

import "example.com/myapp/internal/errs"

type AuthError struct {
	Code errs.Code
}

func (e AuthError) Error() string {
	return string(e.Code)
}

func RequireUser(id string) error {
	if id == "" {
		return AuthError{Code: errs.AuthServiceUserNotFound}
	}
	return nil
}
```

For an entry named `auth_service_user_not_found`, the generated constant is `AuthServiceUserNotFound`.

## How it works

- Language is inferred from the file extension (`.ts`, `.go`, or `.rs`).
- Error names in `errkit.json` use lowercase snake case, then generate PascalCase API names. `errkit generate` normalizes entry names it can safely format and writes the corrected names back to `errkit.json`.
- Each output emits `common` entries plus any scopes it lists, flattened and sorted by name.
- A scoped entry with the same name as a common entry overrides it, with a warning.
- Codes are 6 characters from a human-safe alphabet (no `I`, `L`, `O`, `0`, `1`).
- TypeScript outputs generate PascalCase enum members with JSDoc comments and include ESLint/Oxlint disable comments.
- Go outputs generate a `Code` string type plus PascalCase constants. Package names come from the parent directory (e.g. `internal/errs/errors.go` → `package errs`). Override with `"package": "..."` on the output.
- Rust outputs generate a dependency-free `Err` enum with PascalCase variants, `ALL`, `as_str`, `from_code`, `AsRef<str>`, `Display`, and `std::error::Error`.
- Existing output files are only overwritten when they start with the errkit marker comment.

## Commands

```
errkit init              Create errkit.json in the current directory.
errkit generate          Read errkit.json (walking up from cwd), assign any
                         missing codes, then write every file in `outputs`.
                         Aliases: `gen`, `g`.
```

## Development

```bash
bun install
bun test
bun run build
